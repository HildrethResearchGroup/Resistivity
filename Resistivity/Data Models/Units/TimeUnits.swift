///
/// Seconds are the base unit.
/// This enum conforms to `ConvertableUnits` protocol and provides cases for common time units.
/// It can be used to convert between these units and perform calculations with time values.
///
/// Cases:
///   - microseconds: Represents a microsecond, which is 1.0E-6 of a second.
///   - milliseconds: Represents a millisecond, which is 1.0E-3 of a second.
///   - seconds: Represents a second, the base unit of time in this context.
///   - minutes: Represents a minute, which is equivalent to 60 seconds.
///   - hours: Represents an hour, which is equivalent to 3,600 seconds.
