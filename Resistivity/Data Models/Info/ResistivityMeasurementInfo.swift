    /// If the sample being tested is thicker than 40% of the probe spacing, an additional correction factor is required. The correction factor used is dependent upon the ratio of the sample thickness (t) to the probe spacing (s) and some of the possible values are listed in the table found at:

    /// From: [Ossila Sheet Resistance]( https://www.ossila.com/pages/sheet-resistance-theory).
    /// Whilst the above equation for sheet resistance is independent of sample geometry, this only applies when the sample is significantly larger (typically having dimensions 40 times greater) than the spacing of the probes, and if the sample is thinner than 40% of the probe spacing. If this is not the case, the possible current paths between the probes are limited by the proximity to the edges of the sample, resulting in an overestimation of the sheet resistance. To account for this difference, a correction factor based upon the geometry of the sample is required.
